# Contributing to this project

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.


## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports),
[features requests](#feature-requests) and submitting pull requests, but please
respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use
  [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or IRC).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search.** Check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed.** Try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Provide environment details.** Provide your operating system, browser(s),
   devices, and jquery-wizard version.

4. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Create a [reduced test
   case](http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/).

5. **Include a live example.** Make use of jsFiddle or jsBin to share your
   isolated test cases.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS
experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).


## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.


## Pull Requests

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation,
accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the
project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to
license your work under the same license as that used by the project.


## Code Consitency

To help create consistent looking code throughout the project, we use a few tools to help us. 

#### ESlint
We use [ESlint](http://eslint.org) on each build to find easy-to-catch errors and potential problems in our js.  You can find our ESlint settings in the `.eslintrc.yml` file in the root of the project.

#### EditorConfig

We use [EditorConfig](http://EditorConfig.org) to maintain consistent coding styles between various editors and IDEs.  You can find our settings in the `.editorconfig` file in the root of the project.


## Development

We are using node, gulp and babel to build and (in the future) test this project. This means that you must setup a local development environment:

1. Install `node` and `npm` using your preferred method
2. Install the gulp CLI: `npm install -g gulp-cli`
3. Install the Babel CLI: `npm install -g babel-cli`
4. Install the project's development dependencies: `npm install`

#### Available Tasks
- `gulp` or `gulp watch` Start watch for changes and server with Browsersync.
- `gulp build` Run all development tasks
- `gulp serve` Start server with Browsersync.
- `gulp clean` Clean output directories.
- `gulp bundler` Bundle javasript modules.
- `gulp scripts` Concatenate and minify JavaScript to `dist`.
- `gulp lint:es` Lint ES6 files using eslint.
- `gulp lint:js` Lint Javascript files using jshint.
- `gulp clean` Clean out distribution javascript files.
- `gulp tdd` Test for Test Driven Development purposes.
- `gulp test` Test for Continuous Integration purposes.
